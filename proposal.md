# PROPOSAL FOR THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF ETI-OSA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF LAGOS STATE.  

Distinguished Chairman, Eti-Osa Local Government, Lagos State. 
We are a group of Nigerian youths and residents of Eti-osa Local Government Area who are passionate about the development of our beloved nation and the efficient administration of government towards ensuring improved welfare, security and social justice for Nigerians. 
We emphasize that we are not an association of any description, neither do we have any affiliation with any political association. In addition, we are currently not members of any political party and we do not bear any title or nomenclature with which we can be identified. We are only driven by our passion to contribute to the development of our nation in our little way starting from our immediate environment. 
This proposal contains ideas which we render as suggestions and recommendations for the purpose of fostering the vision of your administration and ultimately the development of Eti-Osa Local Government. A list of these ideas which we shall briefly explain in sequence are as follows:

- Town hall meetings
- Transportation 
- Records (registration of birth death and marriages)
- Drainage 
- Education and child welfare
- Revenue generation for the local government.
These ideas are explained below. 

### Town hall meetings 
Nigeria is no doubt a multi-tiered federation and the local government is conceived as the third tier of government with the closest proximity to the people. Historically, the democratic values that birthed the modern local government system in Nigeria is traceable to the 1976 reform which good intentions included the desire to extend the principle of federation by bringing government to the grassroots level and to achieve uniformity of local government administration across the federation. It is therefore apposite to say that the most potent way of giving effect to an effective grassroot relationship between the people and the local government is regular communication. 
It is true that the government should be accessible at every given time, however, a structure and platform needs to be created for this to happen. Organizing town hall meetings where the people are able to come together on periodic basis (i.e. quarterly) to discuss with the local government on issues that directly affect them is an effective way of bringing government close to the people. At the same time, the local government will be able to use the opportunity to communicate their efforts and achievements to the people. While we do not intend to overemphasize this point, we believe it would be useful to point out some advantages of organizing town hall meetings:
The people will be able to know and identify their local government leaders and vice versa; 
The people will be able to state their needs directly and there will be clear and unbroken chain of communication and understanding between the Local Government and the people. This will in turn help the Local Government to map out people-oriented projects; 
The Local Government will be able to identify the projects to give utmost priority as town hall meetings will help identify the greatest and most urgent needs of the people; 
The local government will be able to share its achievements, efforts and challenges with the people, so that the people can properly appreciate the efforts of the government for executed projects, know what to expect and also to manage their expectations where necessary;
The local government will be able to get ideas, suggestions and even aides from the people;
Misconceptions between the people and the government as well as unnecessary criticisms and attacks on the government will reduce drastically;
We strongly believe that communication between the people and the local government via a town hall meeting which can be broadcasted on media for the benefit of those who are unable to attend will effectively enhance development in the Local Government. According to Nickey Gumbel ‘a lot of problems in the world will be solved if we talk to each other instead of about each other’.  

### Transportation 
Recently, the administration of Governor Akinwumi Ambode in conjunction with the Lekki Concession Company demolished the roundabouts along the Lekki-Epe Expressway and also constructed the Ajah bridge for the purpose of reducing the effect of traffic which stifles economic progress owing to waste of man hours in traffic. While this project was successful and has significantly reduced the traffic situation in the Lekki/Victoria Island axis, we believe that the traffic situation is gradually going back to its former state due to migration. 
In order to further improve the traffic situation in Lekki/Victoria Island axis, we did a random survey and realized that:
The quality of road and the road network between Lekki-Epe Express Way and the stretch up to Ozumba Mbadiwe in Victoria Island is very good and well maintained;
Many of the residents in Lekki/Victoria Island and axis and have personal cars for personal usage;
Apart from commercial vehicles popularly known as “Danfos” and scantily the BTR buses, there are no other means of commercial transportation that can connect people from Lekki to Victoria Island and Ikoyi;
A random statistics shows that about 40 percent of the vehicles that ply the Lekki-Epe Express either within Lekki or from Lekki to Victoria Island and/or Ikoyi have only one passenger which is the driver and only less than 20 percent vehicles have more than two people;
Most of those who drive their personal cars do not do so because it is cheaper or faster, they do so because there are no good or viable alternatives at least not the “danfos” and “old BRT buses”;
If good transportation system (modern shuttles) that fits the elite personality in the Lekki, Victoria Island and Ikoyi are introduced, the traffic situation will reduce as many commuters will consider the decent and cheaper alternative as against driving their personal cars all the time;
We believe that if the local government is able to invest in modern shuttle within the identified axis, the traffic situation will further reduce, the welfare of the people will improve and the Local Government will in turn have an additional source of income. If the cost of running the business will be too huge on the local government, a private public partnership will be advised. 
Records (registration of birth death and marriages)
One of the functions of the local government as contained in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 is the registration of births, deaths and marriages.  
We think that this function is not cosmetic but is a very useful tool in ensuring that each local government is able to account for each citizen under its territory such that where details of a citizen or demography of the people in a local government is required, such can easily be obtained from the database of a local government. 
We recommend that the local government should create a register (preferably electronic database) for all births, deaths and marriages within the local government. The benefit of doing this  are as follows:
The local government will be able to track the increase in its population and factor this into its infrastructural and developmental policies and projects;
The local government will have database and statistical basis to challenge any inconsistent census result that may be conducted by the Census Board of the Federal Government in future;
It will be a means of revenue to the government as each registration will come with a fee albeit little. 
From our assessment, this project can be achieved with minimal efforts if all hospitals and marriage registries within the Local Government are directed to cooperate with the Local Government in providing required information and ensuring that all concerned citizens within the Local Government are mandated to register births, deaths and marriages of people directly connected to them with the local government. 

### Drainage 
The Lekki, Victoria Island and Ikoyi axis are typically know to be swampy or water log area. Most of the residents are usually thrown into serious turbulence during the raining season because of flooding which is occasioned by the nature of the environment and lack of efficient drainage system. 
We believe that a huge drainage system will be required to put paid this problem within the Local Government. Our recommendation therefore is that the Local Government should in conjunction with the Representatives of the House of Assembly and the National Assembly make a case with the Executive arm of Lagos State and the Federal Government to provide efficient drainage systems in the Local Government. 

### Education and  welfare of children
This heading is divided into two parts namely less privileged children and children in school:

### Less privileged children 
We observe that there are a lot of children on the streets and highway in Eti-Osa Local Government who are begging for alms. Many of these children as you may have noticed try to clean the wind screen of vehicle just to be able to attract sympathy for help. Our findings reveal that most of these children are part of the people who were displaced by terrorists’ activities in the Northern part of the country. A big rehabilitation home can be built for these children where they can be taken care of and provided quality education and skill acquisitions that will equip them for the future and completely take them off the streets. If this issue is not looked into and addressed with urgency, these children will pose serious threats to the security and safety of the Local Government and State at large. 
We appreciate the fact that building a rehabilitation home and training the children could be expensive, i.e. cost of acquiring land, construction of buildings, food, water, utilities, payment of teachers, social workers and other professionals. However, there are some measures that can be put in place to make this project less burdensome on the government. First, we are aware that modern constructions experts in Nigeria are able to provide temporary buildings that can be relocated when necessary. If this model is utilized, there will be no need for a permanent acquisition of land or construction of expensive buildings. All that that would need to be done is for the Local Government to either take part of its land or obtain allocation from the state Government. 
Further, awareness can also be created for well-meaning Nigerians to provide volunteer (free) services for the education, training and health of these children as well as food and other utilities.  

### Children in school
Our survey of the public primary and secondary schools in Eti-Osa Local Government shows that Lagos State and the Local Government has invested very well into decent environments for leaning and quality education for the pupils and students. However, we believe there is room for improvement. For children in this category, we propose that Eti-Osa Local Government should collaborate with multinationals and other successful organizations within the local government to provide life scholarships to one thousand students who will be selected on the basis of their academic performance, financial position of their parents and the students’ willingness. The funds raised for these students will be kept in education insurance accounts that will continue to yield interest and disbursed by a commercial or investment Bank as their educational needs arise.  
 
### Revenue generation for the local government.
We know that these ideas we have put forward and many more that this Local Government has in store can only be actualized as much as funds will allow. This is why we also decided to direct our minds to how the Local Government can generate more funds. Guided by the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 and the Eti-Osa Local Government Bye-Law, below is a list of the taxies and levies that the Local Government can impose to generate funds.   
Taxes and Levies to be collected by the Local Government
 
 
1. Shops and kiosks rates.
2. Tenement rates.
3. On and Off Liquor Licence fees.
4. Slaughter slab fees.
5. Marriage, birth and death registration fees.
6. Naming of street registration fee, excluding any street in the State Capital.
7. Right of Occupancy fees on lands in rural areas, excluding those collectable by the Federal and State Governments.
8. Market taxes and levies excluding any market where State finance is involved.
9. Motor park levies.
10. Domestic animal licence fees.
11. Bicycle, truck. canoe, wheelbarrow and cart fees, other than a mechanically propelled truck.
12. Cattle tax payable by cattle farmers only.
13. Merriment and road closure levy.
14. Radio and television licence fees (other than radio and television transmitter).
15. Vehicle radio licence fees (to be imposed by the Local Government of the State in which the car is registered).
16. Wrong parking charges.
17. Public convenience, sewage and refuse disposal fees.
18. Customary burial ground permit fees.
19. Religious places establishment permit fees.
20. Signboard and Advertisement permit fees.
 
Al the above listed taxes are collectable by the Local Government. If they are not, then we are able to assist with structures on how they can all be collected. 
Apart from improving the Local Government’s tax collection base, the Local Government can invest in businesses such as the shuttle business we suggested above and other types of businesses such as bill board advertisement, water transport services, fish farming etc.    
Conclusion 
We know that Nigeria is a great nation with great human and natural resources and potentials. However, we are still far from the realizing our full potentials because we have a lot of challenges that continue hampered our growth. We believe that we can collectively achieve the dream of becoming one of the greatest nations in the world if we collectively confront these challenges and pursue this noble cause. We have chosen this cause as a better way of achieving a better Nigeria rather than heap complaints and criticisms on the government. We are ready and willing to volunteer our skills (professional and otherwise), wisdom, time and money to contribute to the advancement of our immediate society and the nation at large.
We do hope that this proposal will be favourably considered and implemented. We promise to be available to discuss this proposal in details and to provide every necessary support to ensure that the suggestions in the proposal are properly implemented.  
While we look forward to your response, kindly accept the assurances of our highest regards. God bless Eti-Osa Local Government Area. God Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.  
Yours Faithfully,
