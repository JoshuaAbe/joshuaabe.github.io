## EDUCATION: 

AIM: PROVIDING A CONDUSIVE ENVIROMENT FOR LEARNING 

PROJECT: "ONE CHILD ONE DESK"

## PROBLEM
The project "One Child One Desk" is an offshoot of a problem we observed in some public/ private schools in some parts of Africa.  

Many Pupils and Students currently do not have a desk to write on while some have inadequate furniture and often squeeze into the available desks, thereby learning in the most inconvenient manner. With this project, we aim to provide every school aged child with a personal desk for learning. The image below is a visual representation of the kind of problem we are trying to solve.

# OUR STORY 

In pursuit of our passion for human development, especially in the area of education, we
took up the responsibility of paying the tuition of some teenagers we found hawking on the 
streets of Lagos, Nigeria. Towards the end of year 2019 and early 2020, we decided to 
advance our interest in improving education in our immediate community by physically 
inspecting the state of facilities in public primary and secondary schools in Lagos in order 
to identify the facilities we can provide or improve. In the course of our random physical
inspections, we discovered amongst other things that an estimated 30 percent of pupils and 
students in public schools do not have chairs and tables, so the pupils/ students often 
squeeze themselves into the available desks, thereby learning in the most inconvenient
manner. Some classes do not even have desks or chairs. This situation, which we found devastating inspired us to conceive the idea of 
developing a campaign captioned as – “one child, one desk”. This project is going to be our first project as an Organisation because we believe that education is the center of our passion and it is a veritable weapon for the actualization of many conceivable dreams.
